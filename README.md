# SumOdd
SumOdd is a program that, well, sums odd numbers from a range given by the user. It uses two methods. First one, isOdd, checks whether the number is odd. Second method, sumOdd, asks user for two numbers - start and end, respectively. sumOdd uses for loop to go through numbers in given range. isOdd is being called, and when returns true, that specific number is being added to the sum variable. This program is meant to work on positive values only, otherwise returns -1. If start number is greater than end number, it also returns -1.

From my beginner POV it was a nice challenge not to get confused in conditions and syntax shorthands, but I'm kinda proud about coming with all this up by myself :) It also got me exicted about some more advanced stuff, which will appear soon
